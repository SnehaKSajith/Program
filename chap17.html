        <td><p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code 
            readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to 
            help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-
            collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and 
            functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first 
            released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list 
            comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system (in addition to reference counting). Python 3.0 was released 
            in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with 
            version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p></td></tr></table>

        <td><p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation 
            dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere 
            (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java 
            applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
            computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
            The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not 
            available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use 
            according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.Java was 
            originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 
            as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual 
            machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance 
            with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the 
            GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is 
            the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all 
            Linux distributions.As of October 2021, Java 17 is the latest version. Java 8, 11 and 17 are the current long-term support 
            (LTS) versions. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for 
            commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other 
            vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.
            Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, because of serious risks 
            due to unresolved security issues.[22] Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to a supported version, such 
            as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17).</p></td></tr></table>

        <td><p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian 
            programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood 
            for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP code is usually 
            processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
            executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as 
            generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web 
            content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of 
            that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone 
            graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.The standard 
            PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported 
            and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.The PHP language evolved without a 
            written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard 
            which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification. W3Techs 
            reports that, as of April 2021, "PHP is used by 79.2% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know." 
            PHP version 7.4 is the most used versions, then 7.3 which lost support on 6 December 2021.</p></td></tr></table>
